A few decades ago, Kerala was seen as a dairy unfriendly State and had to depend primarily on the
neighboring States for its milk supply. However, today, Kerala is almost self-sufficient in milk
production. The credit for this largely goes to Kerala Co-operative Society, customer friendly policies,
modern management and most important of all the integrated co-operative participation by the
farmers. The society usually works in an old fashion by recording all the details (customer info,
consumer info, payment info, subsidies info, loan info, and insurance info) manually via book keeping
and awareness programs are being conducted through seminars or printed media.

where all the services and activities are being performed in modern and secure fashion.
